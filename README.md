- ## Install: 
1. Clone the proyect.
2. npm i
3. Create ormconfig.json in the root of the proyect:
  ```json       
    {
        "type": "mysql",
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 3306,
        "username": "root",
        "password": "",
        "database": "monitor_procesos",
        "entities": [
        "dist/**/**.entity{.ts,.js}"
        ],
        "synchronize": true
    }
  ```
4. Create database called "monitor-procesos"
5. Import [this Dump file]() into the database. 

- ## Usage:
  - Log-in with test users: 
 
    Privilege      | Username   | Password
    ----------     | ---------  | --------
    **Admin**      | admin      | admin
    **Supervisor** | supervisor | supervisor
    **Client**     | client     | client

  - To create a new company, from DB:
    - Insert a row into 'user' table with **privilege= "admin"**  and **companyId = null**
